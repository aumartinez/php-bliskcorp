          <strong>BliskÂ® Corp.</strong> was established initially as Blisk Systems LLC  in early 2017. On our 2nd incorporation in Florida, we did it as BLISK CORP. Which acquired the earlier and it became the subsidiary.

          Back in 2016, while our founder and CEO visited Poland, he met Dr. Zbigniew Dobkowski who introduced him to the disinfection inherent in UV-C and they discussed the infection prevention equipment that could be developed. Discussions were central to identifying problems, needs, and solutions. Unbeknownst to them, two US teams were very close to discovering the safe UV-C wavelength to human skin and eyes while still being very deadly to pathogens.

          When Covid-19 became a Pandemic our founder and CEO was moved to look into what could be done to help the world-wide mounting problem by deploying the decontamination chamber he and his co-inventor had conceived earlier and discovered that a great deal of research had been continued and the discovery of the safe UV-C wavelength. Our founder also reviewed other huge challenges facing humanity and decided to forge ahead with a revitalized sense of mission.
